Tweaks
======

swap vowels at end = nono? Or for any other.
Not deleting three lots of letters (add new letters as array element, not in one array element.
take chances to mutate down generally.
Way too much 'y'. More on two-name?
Repeating elements again - weird.




Elements KEEP getting repeated - shouldn't be that much.
Still hanging on epenthesis, 
No doubling at the start.
The repeating of elements does mean that they share elements on the map, though.
Don't swap an n after a k.
More 'smoothing' of three-clause names. Sometimes smooth into two syllables.
only tweak vowel if it isn't next to another vowel.
no c -> g lenition or n -> m unless at start of word.
Only 5 retries for each of these so doesn't get stuck.
get rid of three letters not working (esp. second time)

## To Do

- Keep making tweaks until names are generating well.
- Capture 20 full-size screenshots of OS maps (fullest resolution before going sub-Explorer, roughly 1800px wide).
- Remove a few key placenames.
- Identify 4 'slots' for fake names on each map. Save px coordinates for each in script.
- Check the site's performance.
- Add copy/change where needed.
- Test with people?
- Create Github repo.
- Make site responsive (not usable on phones)
- Publish, achievements list.
