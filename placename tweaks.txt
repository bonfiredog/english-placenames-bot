Tweaks
======

Repeating elements again - weird.
The repeating of elements does mean that they share elements on the map, though.
More 'smoothing' of three-clause names. Sometimes smooth into two syllables.
only tweak vowel if it isn't next to another vowel.
no c -> g lenition or n -> m unless at start of word.
Placenames fuzzy on laptop - to do with odd screen resolution? Test at other resolutions: may nee dto make text-shadw responsive. (Test on Sarah's machine).
Even less chance of mutation?
Finding syllables - mutating more for three+?

## To Do

- Keep making tweaks until names are generating well.
- Capture 20 full-size screenshots of OS maps (fullest resolution before going sub-Explorer, roughly 1800px wide).
- Remove a few key placenames.
- Identify 4 'slots' for fake names on each map. Save px coordinates for each in script.
- Check the site's performance.
- Add copy/change where needed.
- Test with people?
- Create Github repo.
- Make site responsive (not usable on phones)
- Publish, achievements list.
